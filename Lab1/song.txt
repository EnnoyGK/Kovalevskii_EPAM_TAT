I do my best, but everything seems ominous
Not feeling blessed, quite the opposite
This shouldn't feel so monotonous
It never rains, but it pours

We're just a bunch of fucking animals
But we're afraid of the outcome
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in
Says I should pull the pin

Should I just pull the pin?
Should I just pull the pin?

I dug my heels, I thought that I could stop the rot
The ground gave way, now I've lost the plot
Fucked it again, that was all I've got
It never rains, but it pours
